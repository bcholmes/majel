    "CALIBRATE SENSORS 2e": "You work to fine-tune the sensors to get the clearest readings. On your next Sensor Operations action, you may either ignore a single trait affecting the task, or re-roll 1d20.",
    "LAUNCH PROBE 2e": "You launch a sensor probe in order to study a situation or phenomenon in more depth or from a safe distance. Select a single zone anywhere within Long range: you launch a probe which flies to that zone. Sensor Operations major actions may determine range from the probeâ€™s location rather than the ship. The probe can be targeted as if a Small Craft, and it is destroyed if it takes any damage."
