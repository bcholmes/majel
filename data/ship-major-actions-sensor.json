    "CREATE TRAIT 2e": "In addition to the standard Create Trait action description on page 289, note that, from sensor operations, this action is often useful for creating traits that reflect important information that has been detected or discovered.",
    "REVEAL 2e": "You scan for the trace signals that may reveal the tell-tale presence of a cloaked vessel, or a vessel concealed by some other phenomenon. Attempt a Reason + Science task, assisted by the ship’s Sensors + Science, with a Difficulty of 3. If you succeed, and there is a hidden vessel within Long range, you reveal which zone it is in (if there are multiple, this only reveals one such vessel, chosen at random). Until that vessel moves, your ship may attack that hidden vessel, but increasing the Difficulty by 2.",
    "SCAN FOR WEAKNESS 2e": "You scan an enemy vessel, looking for vulnerabilities. Choose a single vessel and attempt a Control + Science task with a Difficulty of 2, assisted by the ship’s Sensors + Security. If this succeeds, the next attack made against that ship increases its damage by 2, or gains the Piercing quality.",
    "SENSOR SWEEP 2e": "You use the sensors to scan for information. Select a single zone to scan, and attempt a Reason + Science task, assisted by the ship’s Sensors + Science, with a Difficulty of 1. If successful, the gamemaster provides basic information on any ships, objects, or other phenomena in that zone; you may spend Momentum to get extra information as normal."
